This classic steak and eggs breakfast is perfect for those following a high-protein, low-carb diet. The combination provides a substantial amount of complete protein to fuel your day, along with healthy fats for sustained energy.

## Why This Recipe Works

The key to perfect steak and eggs is timing. By cooking the steak first and letting it rest while you prepare the eggs, everything comes together at the perfect temperature. The steak continues to cook slightly while resting, and the residual heat keeps it warm until serving.

## Nutrition Benefits

This meal is incredibly nutrient-dense, providing:

- High-quality complete protein from both the steak and eggs
- Iron, zinc, and B vitamins from the beef
- Choline and lutein from the egg yolks
- Healthy fats for hormone production and brain health

### Key Vitamins and Minerals

- **Vitamin B12**: Essential for nerve function and red blood cell formation. This meal provides over 200% of your daily needs.
- **Iron**: Critical for oxygen transport and energy production. This meal provides heme iron, which is significantly more bioavailable than plant sources.
- **Zinc**: Supports immune function and protein synthesis. Beef is one of the richest dietary sources.
- **Selenium**: An important antioxidant that supports thyroid function.

## Variations

- **Leaner Option**: Substitute ribeye with sirloin steak to reduce fat content while maintaining protein levels
- **Extra Flavor**: Add saut√©ed mushrooms or a small avocado for more nutrients and healthy fats
- **Spicy Kick**: Serve with a side of hot sauce or salsa for added flavor without extra calories

This breakfast will keep you satisfied for hours and provides a solid nutritional foundation for active days or workout recovery.
